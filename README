The ocp kata tecnique forces an open closed implementation. Any new feature should be implementable with extension and no modification. If that is not possibile, then the test for the new feature must be ignored, and a refactoring is needed in order to make the preexisting design able to implement the new feature by extensions and no modifications, after the refactoring then you de-ignore the test and should be able to make the test pass only adding new classes or modifying the factory.

If you need an "oracle" to compute the bowling score, here it is:

The code has been tested in dot.net framework 3.5

The flexible part of the bowling game instance is the constraints about the frame creation, and the way to compute the bonus.
