OCP KATA BOWLING

Original bowling kata description: http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata

The ocp kata tecnique forces an implementation that will respect the open closed principle. The rule is that any new feature must be implemented with extension and no modification. If that is not possibile, then the test for the new feature must be ignored, and a refactoring is needed in order to make the preexisting base code ready to let implementation of the new feature with extensions and no modifications. 
So then the test can be de-ignored, and you should be able to make it pass just modifing the factory and-or adding new classes.

If you need an "oracle" to compute the bowling score, here it is:

The code has been tested in dot.net framework 3.5

The flexible part of the bowling game instance is the constraints about the frame creation, and the way to compute the bonus.
